  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented by changing backend register() to return null instead of trapping when caller is non-guest. REQ-2 is not evidenced in the diff: the frontend constants and shown code do not include/route to the required friendly ALREADY_REGISTERED message, and there is no visible logic mapping the backend re-registration signal to that message.",

      "requirement": "Update frontend registration error handling so re-registration attempts show the friendly message `This account is already registered. Please sign in instead.` (AUTH_MESSAGES.ALREADY_REGISTERED) and never display the raw backend trap text.",
