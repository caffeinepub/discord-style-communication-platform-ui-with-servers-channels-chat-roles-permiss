  "summary": "Diff adds a new UserProfileOverlay component and wires profile opening from both the Members list and chat message author (avatar/name) clicks using navigation state (selectedMemberId). Overlay renders profile fields via existing useGetUserProfile hook and is mounted at the App shell level.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-38",
      "requirement": "Overlay includes an explicit Close control (and supports standard dismiss like Escape/outside click) that clears the selection and hides the overlay.",
      "reason": "In the provided (truncated) overlay code, a handleClose function exists, but the snippet does not show any Close button/control rendered, nor does it show Dialog/Sheet open-state wiring (e.g., onOpenChange) that would invoke handleClose on dismiss (Escape/outside click). Since the file is truncated, this may exist below, but it is not evidenced in the diff excerpt.",
