  "architectural_notes": [
    "Deliverables are a complete UI/UX concept with reusable Figma components, named layers, auto-layout, consistent typography/spacing, icon system, and clearly separated design tokens.",
    "Target is a Discord-like experience (as of ~Jan 2026 feature set) while remaining customizable as its own branded platform.",
    "Authentication scope expanded: implement custom login system and session management (including logout) that integrates with the app UI and any backend authorization checks.",
    "Username must be treated as a mutable, unique handle: design backend/API validation and UI flows for changing @username safely (uniqueness, formatting, potential cooldown).",
    "Channel creation should be accessible from Server Settings → Channels (in addition to any sidebar/context-menu entry points), reusing the same category/channel data model and admin authorization checks.",
    "Define a permissions resolution model: base role permissions + per-channel overrides with explicit precedence/deny-vs-allow behavior and admin authorization checks.",
    "Project scope expanded beyond UI-only: implement functional text chat and voice channels requiring backend APIs and (if applicable) realtime transport/signaling."
